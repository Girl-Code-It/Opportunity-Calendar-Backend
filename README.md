<h2 align="center">Project Structure</h2>

We will structure our application using the controller, service, and, manager pattern so our app will be broken into the managers, services, and controllers. The `Manager-Service-Controller` pattern breaks up the business layer of the app into three distinct layers:

1. The `manager class` handles getting data into and out of our data store. A manager is used between the service layer and the model layer. For example, in the opportunityManager you would create methods that write/read a opportunity to and from the database.
2. The `service class` calls the manager class and can combine their data to form new, more complex business objects. It is an abstraction between the controller and the manager.
3. A `controller` contains very little logic and is used to make calls to services.
